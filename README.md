## How to clone this repo

This template uses the same setup as the D3 crashcourse template.

To run it, use the following commands:

1. Install Node.js and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. Clone this repository, and cd into the directory.
3. Open VSCode and open the folder you just cloned.
4. In this folder, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
5. Open the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000/). If you open the html file directly, your changes will not update the website.
6. Run `npm run dev` to watch for changes and host the web application.

You can add any changes to github using `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"` and `git push origin master`.
